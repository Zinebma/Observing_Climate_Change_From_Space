# Observing_Climate_Change_From_Space
Analysis of Arctic sea ice dynamics using satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) data. Includes MATLAB code, visualisations, and award-winning project insights.

# Observing Climate Change from Space 🌍🛰️

Analysis of Arctic sea ice dynamics using satellite-derived **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)** and **Sea Surface Salinity (SSS)** data.  
This repo showcases my award-winning project at the University of Bath, where our team won **Best Group Presentation**.

---

## ✨ Highlights
- Explored the relationship between SST, SSS, and Arctic sea ice thickness (2010–2016).
- Used **MATLAB** to process NetCDF data and generate:
  - Line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
  - Animated visualisations of climate events like **El Niño / La Niña**.
- Implemented good practice in **data handling, uncertainty analysis, and sustainability awareness**.
